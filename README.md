# AggregationCS – Scientific Computing for the French Agrégation

This repository gathers a set of **Python scripts** and **Jupyter notebooks** designed as preparation material for the *concours de l’Agrégation de Mathématiques* (oral exam in *calcul scientifique*).

The collection covers a wide range of **applied mathematics topics** and **numerical methods**, each file focusing on a specific classical application. It can be used both for training and for demonstration during oral examinations.

## Purpose

These notebooks are **not just coding exercises**:  
they are **didactic demos** intended for oral presentation at the Agrégation.  
They highlight:
- key numerical methods,  
- interpretation of results (stability, convergence, conservation),  
- links to **applied domains** (physics, biology, control, optimization).
